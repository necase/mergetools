Tools to help merge two directories into one

If identical files in different subdirectories should be kept, use rmerge.sh or rmerge.py
If files in dir2 that are identical to some file in dir1 should be removed, use rmerge.py -s

rcmp will compare the contents of files in two directories (like cmp but compares contents of all files in a directory instead of contents of a single file)
dedup.py will find duplicate files within a single directory (maybe call it telldup or finddup instead?)
